# Erratum for the STARFORGE methods paper (Grudic et al 2021)

Here you will find materials associated with an erratum for the [STARFORGE simulation methods paper](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/506/2/2199/6276745), in which we explain the correction to our original incorrect dust opacity model. `planck_mean.py` generates all figures and tables, and `planck_mean_opacity.dat` and `rosseland_mean_opacity.dat` tabulate mean opacities for the Semenov 2003 porous 5-layered sphere model.
